# Third-Party Notices

This project builds on the following software and assets. Nothing proprietary
is redistributed here; robot models and pretrained checkpoints are fetched at
runtime from NVIDIA's servers under their own terms.

| NVIDIA Isaac Sim 4.5 | [NVIDIA Omniverse License Agreement](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/platform/latest/common/NVIDIA_Omniverse_License_Agreement.html) | Simulation runtime (pip `isaacsim`) |
| NVIDIA pretrained RL checkpoints | NVIDIA Omniverse asset terms; auto-downloaded via `--use_pretrained_checkpoint` | Policy weights for the rollout video (trained by NVIDIA; no training data is included or redistributed in this repo) |
| Spot USD model | Distributed with NVIDIA Omniverse assets; Spot is a product and trademark of Boston Dynamics | Robot asset, auto-downloaded at runtime |
